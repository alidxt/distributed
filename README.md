# Blockchain Certificate Revocation with Merkle Tree

This project implements a blockchain-based certificate verification and revocation system
using Ethereum smart contracts and an off-chain Merkle Tree for revocations.

## Components
- EducationVerification.sol: University blockchain logic
- IdentityRegistry.sol: Top-layer identity redirection
- Merkle tree off-chain builder
- Demo scripts (issue, revoke, verify)
