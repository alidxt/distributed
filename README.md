# Blockchain-Based Academic Certificate Issuance & Revocation

## Overview

This project implements a **blockchain-based system for issuing, revoking, and verifying academic certificates** using Ethereum smart contracts and Hardhat.

The goal is to provide:
- **Tamper-proof issuance**
- **Immutable revocation records**
- **On-chain timestamps**
- **Cryptographic verification**
- **Full auditability via blockchain event logs**

The system is designed for **Distributed Systems & Blockchain coursework**, focusing on correctness, traceability, and trust minimization.
